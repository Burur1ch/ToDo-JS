# ToDo-JS
*This is a list of tasks you need to complete or things you want to do. Most often they are organized in order of priority.*
**Is a to-do list irreplaceable?**
*One of the most significant benefits of a why-to-do list is that it helps you stay organized. It will also help you appear more manageable.*

*You can stay more focused because you have a plan for what you need to do and what you have already captured.
A wide range of tasks opens up a place in the mind and allows you to realize more creativity.*
